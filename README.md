# GoF-design-patterns-matlab
A collection of MATLAB implementations of the Gang-of-Four design patterns

This repository will be updated with MATLAB implementations of the Gang-of-Four design patterns[1]. The implementations are based in two existing collections of Java implementations of the patterns, namely by James Cooper and Bruce Eckel.

This work is being done in the context of a master thesis at FCT NOVA, titled "Assessing MATLAB's OO features through the GoF patterns".
